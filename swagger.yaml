        This route accepts user input, validates the provided data, and checks whether the user's email is already registered. If the email is not already in use, a new user record is created in the database. Following successful registration, a one-time password (OTP) code is generated and sent to the user's email address for verification.

        This route verifies a user's account by accepting a One-Time Password (OTP) that was sent to their email during the signup process. Upon receiving a valid OTP, the system marks the user as verified, allowing them to access restricted features. If the OTP is incorrect, expired, or missing, an appropriate error response is returned. This ensures that only legitimate users can complete the registration process.

            The 200 status code indicates that the OTP has been successfully verified. This means the user's account has been marked as verified, granting them full access to all features and services that require verification. Additionally, an access token and refresh token are set in HTTP-only cookies, ensuring the user is authenticated without needing to log in again. At this stage, the user is considered fully registered and authenticated, and no further verification steps are required.

  # RESEND VERIFICATION CODE ENDPOINT
  /auth/resend:
    post:
      description: |-
        This endpoint allows unverified users to request a new verification email.  
        If a user has not received the original verification email or if the verification code has expired, they can use this route to resend the email.  
        Only unverified users can access this endpoint, and the frontend is responsible for preventing verified users from making this request.  
        A new verification email with a fresh code will be sent upon a successful request.

        This route is used for logging in a user by verifying their credentials (email and password). Upon receiving the correct email and password, the system authenticates the user. If authentication is successful, an access token and refresh token are generated and set in HTTP-only cookies. These tokens are used to maintain the user's session and authenticate further requests. The access token is used for immediate authentication, while the refresh token is used to obtain a new access token when it expires, ensuring a seamless and secure login experience.

            The 200 status code indicates that the login was successful. This means the user's email and password have been validated, and they are now authenticated. Upon successful login, the system generates an access token and a refresh token, which are set in HTTP-only cookies. The access token provides immediate authentication, while the refresh token allows the user to obtain a new access token when it expires. The user is now considered logged in and can access protected resources. No further login steps are required unless the session expires or the user logs out.

  # REFRESH THE TOKENS ENDPOINT
  /auth/token/refresh:
    post:
      description: |-
        This endpoint is used to refresh access and refresh tokens when the user's access token has expired.If the request contains a refresh token, the system first verifies its existence.If the token is not found, the request is rejected with a 401 Unauthorized response.If the token exists, the system verifies its validity and checks if it was issued by our system.If the refresh token is invalid or was not issued by our system, all tokens are removed from cookies,and a 401 Unauthorized response is sent with an appropriate error message.If the refresh token is valid and recognized, new access and refresh tokens are generated, set in cookies,and returned with a 200 OK response.

        "200":
          description: |-
            The 200 status indicates that the refresh token provided in the request is valid and has been successfully verified. Upon validation, the system issues a new access token and refresh token, replacing the previous ones and securely storing them in cookies. This ensures continuous authentication without requiring the user to log in again. The token rotation mechanism enhances security by periodically updating tokens, reducing the risk of unauthorized access while maintaining a seamless user experience.

        This endpoint is used to log out an authenticated user by removing authentication tokens from cookies. The system first verifies the presence and validity of the access token stored in cookies. If the token is missing, expired, or invalid (i.e., not issued by our server), the request is rejected with a `401 Unauthorized` response. If the token is valid, all authentication tokens are cleared from cookies, and a `200 OK` response is returned, confirming a successful logout.

            The 200 status indicates that the user has been successfully logged out. Upon verification of a valid access token, all authentication tokens are removed from cookies, ensuring the user is fully logged out. This response confirms a successful logout process without requiring further action from the user.

      description: |-
        This endpoint is used to initiate the password reset process. When a user requests a password recovery with their email, the system first validates whether the provided email is in a proper format. If the email format is incorrect, a 400 Bad Request status is returned. If the format is valid, the system searches for the email in its resources. If the email is not found, a 404 Not Found response is returned. However, if the email exists, the system retrieves the user's information and temporarily stores it in Redis for the next step. A token is then generated using the user's ID, and a 200 OK status is returned. The token is set in cookies, ensuring secure authentication for the following steps. No payload is included in the response. If any unexpected server error occurs, a 500 Internal Server Error status is returned.
      requestBody:
        required: true
        description: |-
          The request body should contain the user's email address. This email is used to check if the user exists in the system and to initiate the password reset process. The email must be in a valid format, and if it is not, a `400 Bad Request` status will be returned. The email provided will be checked against the system's records to determine if an account associated with it exists.

            The 200 OK status indicates that the provided email was successfully found in the system. Upon locating the user, their information is temporarily stored in Redis for the next step of the recovery process. A token is then generated using the user’s ID and securely set in HTTP-only cookies. No payload is included in the response to maintain security. The user can now proceed with the password reset process, ensuring a seamless and protected account recovery experience.

      description: |-
        This endpoint is used to initiate the process of sending an OTP (One-Time Password) for password recovery. The user provides their unique user ID in the request. The system first verifies whether a user with the provided ID exists in the database. If no user is found with the provided ID, a `400 Bad Request` status is returned. If the user is found, an OTP is generated and sent to the user's registered email or phone number, and a `200 OK` status is returned, indicating that the OTP has been successfully sent.
      requestBody:
        required: true
        description: |-
          The request body requires the user's unique identifier (`userId`).  
          This ID is used to identify the user in the system and resend the verification email.

An OTP (One-Time Password) has been generated and sent to the user's registered contact information, such as their email or phone number. This status confirms that the password recovery process has been initiated, and the user can now proceed with using the OTP for resetting their password.

      description: |-
        This endpoint is used to verify the OTP during the password reset process. The user must provide their unique request ID and OTP. The system first checks whether the OTP has expired. If the OTP is still valid, it is compared with the one stored in Redis. If the OTP matches, a `200 OK` status is returned, confirming successful verification. If the OTP does not match or has expired, a `400 Bad Request` status is returned.

            The 200 status code indicates that the OTP has been successfully verified, meaning the provided OTP matches the one stored in Redis and has not expired. As a result, the user is allowed to proceed to the next step of resetting their password without requiring further OTP verification. To maintain security, the system may clear the OTP from Redis after successful validation. This response ensures a seamless and secure password recovery process, preventing unauthorized access while allowing the user to regain account access efficiently.

        This endpoint allows an authenticated user to add their education details. When a user submits a request, they must include their authentication credentials in the form of an access token stored in cookies. The system first verifies the validity of the token. If the token is invalid or missing, a 401 Unauthorized status is returned. If authentication is successful, the request body is validated to ensure that all required fields are properly filled and follow the correct format. If any validation errors occur, a 400 Bad Request status is returned. If the request is valid, a new education record is created and stored in the system, and a 201 Created status is sent in response, confirming that the education details were successfully added. In the event of a server error, a 500 Internal Server Error status is returned.
      requestBody:
        required: true
        description: |-
          The request body must include the necessary education details to be added to the user's profile. The required fields are the institute name, graduation status (whether the user has graduated or not), start date, end date, and a description. The system validates the provided data to ensure all required fields are properly filled and formatted. If any field is missing or incorrectly formatted, the request will be rejected with a 400 Bad Request status. A successfully validated request will result in the creation of a new education record linked to the user's profile.

        This endpoint allows an authenticated user to retrieve their education details based on their preferences, such as specific fields. The request must include a valid access token in the authentication credentials stored in cookies. Upon successful authentication, the system extracts the user ID from the decoded token and fetches the user's education records from the database. The retrieved records are sorted from the most recent to the oldest and returned in the response with a 200 OK status.If the user fails to provide valid authentication credentials, a 401 Unauthorized status is returned. In case of any server-related issues, a 500 Internal Server Error status is sent, ensuring that errors are properly communicated to the user.

            The 401 Unauthorized status indicates that the request lacks valid authentication credentials. This occurs when the user does not provide an access token, the token is expired, or the token is invalid. As a result, the request is rejected, and no action is performed. To resolve this, the user must ensure they are logged in and include a valid access token in the request. If the issue persists, refreshing the authentication token or re-authenticating may be necessary.

        This route allows an authenticated user to retrieve their specific education details. When the user accesses this route, they must include their credentials via a cookie containing a valid access token. The server first checks the validity of the access token; if the token is valid, the payload is decoded to extract the user ID. Based on this user ID, the system fetches the corresponding education record. If the education details are successfully retrieved, the server responds with a 200 OK status, including the requested education data. If the access token is missing, expired, or invalid, the server returns a 401 Unauthorized status, indicating the authentication credentials are incorrect. In the event of a server error, such as issues accessing the database or other unforeseen problems, the server responds with a 500 Internal Server Error status.
      responses:
        "200":
          description: |-
            The "200" response indicates that the request was successful and the server has returned the requested education details. This means the user was properly authenticated, and the system was able to retrieve the education information based on the provided user ID. The response includes the education data in the response body, allowing the user to view their education profile information. The status code 200 signifies that everything has worked as expected without any issues or errors during the process.

            The 401 Unauthorized status indicates that the request lacks valid authentication credentials. This occurs when the user does not provide an access token, the token is expired, or the token is invalid. As a result, the request is rejected, and no action is performed. To resolve this, the user must ensure they are logged in and include a valid access token in the request. If the issue persists, refreshing the authentication token or re-authenticating may be necessary.

        This route allows an authenticated user to update their specific education details. To access this route, the user must include their credentials via a cookie containing a valid access token. Upon receiving the request, the server verifies the validity of the access token. If the token is valid, the user ID is extracted from the token’s payload. The system then proceeds to update the user's education details in the database based on the provided id. The request body must include the updated education information in the appropriate format. If the update is successful, the server responds with a 200 OK status, including a success message and the updated education data. However, if the access token is missing, expired, or invalid, the server returns a 401 Unauthorized status, indicating that the user must authenticate before proceeding. If any error occurs during the update process, such as issues with the database or the provided data, the server returns a 400 Bad Request or 500 Internal Server Error, depending on the nature of the issue. This ensures that users are informed of any issues with their update attempt. The PUT method allows for a complete replacement of the education record, requiring the user to provide the full set of data for the resource being updated.
      requestBody:
        description: |-
          The requestBody for the PUT /profile/education/:id route contains the data needed to update a specific education record for the authenticated user. This body should include all the relevant details of the education entry the user wishes to modify. The required fields typically include the instituteName, isGraduated status, startAt and endAt dates, and a description of the course or degree completed. The request body should be structured in JSON format, and all fields must be provided for the update to be successful. If any field is missing or the data is malformed, the server may respond with a 400 Bad Request status. The user must ensure the provided data is valid to avoid errors. If the data is successfully validated, the server updates the existing education record and returns the updated information in the response. The requestBody serves as the critical input to trigger the update process, ensuring that the user's education profile is kept up-to-date.

            The 401 Unauthorized status indicates that the request lacks valid authentication credentials. This occurs when the user does not provide an access token, the token is expired, or the token is invalid. As a result, the request is rejected, and no action is performed. To resolve this, the user must ensure they are logged in and include a valid access token in the request. If the issue persists, refreshing the authentication token or re-authenticating may be necessary.

      description: |-
        This route allows an authenticated user to delete a specific education record from their profile. To access this route, the user must provide their authentication credentials via a cookie containing a valid access token. Upon receiving the request, the server verifies the validity of the access token and extracts the user ID from its payload. If the token is valid, the system proceeds to locate and remove the specified education record from the database using the provided education ID. A successful deletion results in a 200 OK response, confirming that the education record has been removed. If the access token is missing, expired, or invalid, the server returns a 401 Unauthorized status, requiring the user to re-authenticate. Additionally, if the specified education ID does not exist or belongs to another user, the server may respond with a 404 Not Found error. In cases where an unexpected error occurs during the deletion process, such as database issues or server failures, a 500 Internal Server Error is returned. This ensures that the user is informed about the success or failure of their deletion attempt while maintaining security and data integrity.

This confirms that the authenticated user provided a valid request, and the system successfully processed the deletion. The response body includes a confirmation message, ensuring that the user is aware of the successful removal of their education record. Once deleted, the education entry is permanently removed from the database and cannot be recovered. If the user attempts to access the deleted record after this operation, the system will return a 404 Not Found response. This ensures proper feedback and maintains data consistency within the system.

This occurs when the user does not provide an access token, the token is expired, or the token is invalid. As a result, the request is rejected, and no action is performed. To resolve this, the user must ensure they are logged in and include a valid access token in the request. If the issue persists, refreshing the authentication token or re-authenticating may be necessary.

        This endpoint allows an authenticated user to add their work experience details to their profile. When a user submits a request, authentication is first verified using an access token stored in cookies. If the token is missing, invalid, or expired, the request is rejected with a 401 Unauthorized status. If authentication is successful, the system extracts the user ID from the decoded payload of the token. Using this user ID, a new experience document is created and stored in the database. Upon successful creation, a 201 Created status is returned, confirming that the experience details have been successfully added to the user’s profile. In the case of an unexpected server error, a 500 Internal Server Error status is returned, indicating that the request could not be processed due to an issue on the server side.
      requestBody:
        required: true
        description: |-
          The request body must include the necessary details about the user's work experience. The required fields are: company name, which specifies the organization where the user has worked; description, providing additional details about the role or responsibilities; employment type, indicating whether the job was full-time, part-time, contract, or freelance; job mode, specifying if the work was remote, onsite, or hybrid; start at, representing the date when the user began the job; end at, marking the last working date (if applicable); designation, defining the job title or position held; and active employee, a boolean value indicating whether the user is currently employed at this company. These details help build a comprehensive professional profile for the user.

        This endpoint allows the authenticated user to add a new social media link to their profile. The user must provide the `platformName` (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.) and the corresponding `profileLink` (URL to their profile on that platform). The user must be authenticated to access this resource. Upon successful creation of the social link, a **201 Created** response will be returned, including the details of the newly created social media link. If the user is not authenticated, a **401 Unauthorized** status will be returned. If the data is invalid (e.g., missing required fields), a **400 Bad Request** response will be returned. In case of a server error, a **500 Internal Server Error** status will be returned.
